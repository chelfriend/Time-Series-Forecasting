# Time-Series-Forecasting

We generate synthetic time series data spanning the year 2022.
We split the data into training and testing sets, using the first 10 months for training and the last 2 months for testing.
We fit an ARIMA model to the training data and use it to forecast values for the testing period.
We fit a linear regression model to the training data and use it to forecast values for the testing period.
We visualize the training data, testing data, ARIMA forecast, and linear regression forecast on a single plot.
